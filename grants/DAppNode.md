## DAppNode: The Infrastructure for the Decentralized World
### Aragon Nest Proposal Request for Funding: 

**Team Name:** DAppNode  
 
**Proof of Concept:** https://github.com/dappnode/dappnode and https://dappnode.io/
 
## Abstract



What happens when you’ve got to use a Decentralized P2P network, but securing your own nodes takes a lot of time and effort? 

You see what we have now, a Decentralization bottleneck.  

1. At no point in the last 2 years has there been more than 13,000 Bitcoin nodes online and that number got as low as [5500](https://bitnodes.earn.com/dashboard/?days=730) 
 
2. MetaMask and MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto are the primary wallets used on Ethereum and most users are using these wallets’ default nodes… This is a huge centralizing force in Ethereum.

3. The people who do run their own node end up [having to spend a lot of time, troubleshooting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/83a34l/centralization_in_ethereum_infura_metamask/) keeping it updated and synced without the ability to easily share their node (and efforts) with family and friends. 


DAppNode is creating an infrastructure that addresses these issues and more by building a simple, easy, self-empowering system made specifically for hosting P2P clients for DApps, Cryptocurrencies, decentralized websites, IPFS, and more. Members of the [WHG](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvp5b3/how-ethereum-coders-hacked-back-to-rescue-dollar208-million-in-ethereum?lipi=urn%253Ali%253Apage%253Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_treasury%253B7v09na8XQqySEuI%252FPn%252Bx5Q%253D%253D) believe DAppNode is an essential censorship resistant tool that will empower everyone to join the decentralized world we are all working towards.
## The Desired Final User Story: 

Luis has several cryptocurrencies he follows and is ready to stop using his laptop to run clients, but doesn’t want to have to pay a monthly subscription in fiat to some company he doesn’t trust with his private keys.

He hears about DAppNode and decides to buy a top of the line preloaded DAppNode Server (as opposed to buying his own server and installing the software himself) from one of the many certified independent vendors.

Its delivered to Luis’s front door, and when he opens the box he finds a simple 2 step instruction card: 

- Step #1.) Plug in the Server. 

- Step #2.) Go to dappnode.org/initialize
On this website there will be an extremely simple walk-thru to set up the credentials and choose which clients to deploy.
- By just checking a few boxes Luis deploys his own VPN; gains access to the decentralized version of MyCrypto.com directly connected to his own node.; Ethereum, Bitcoin, Monero and Dogecoin Full nodes; 
- A ZenCash Secure Node and DASH Master Node; 
- He joined the IPFS Consortium making it possible to pin the files of his favorite projects like Aragon, Giveth, Status and Swarm City among others, becoming a supporter of these projects with a couple of clicks.
- Deployed a TrueBit Verifier and Livepeer node; and hosted Giveth, Swarm City, Status, and Decentraland Helper DApps to ensure that his interaction with these DApps cannot be censored and are fully trustless. 


Luis then tells his friends and family that he is the admin for his own DAppNode and is able to send them a link to set up their own credentials with access his DAppNode, and Luis can deploy any other DApps that him or his friends and family want to have hosted with a couple clicks.

Even though Luis opted to buy a very powerful DAppNode, he ends up being able to pay off the cost in 2 months with the profits made from his ZenCash, Swarm City, DASH and TrueBit Nodes. He also canceled his VPN and all of his Digital Ocean accounts because now he has his own server that he can host all of his services on. Without even trying, Luis has a couple extra hundred dollars a month because he’s running the many services that incentivize node operators on his own personal server.

We have been working on this project mostly part time since October of last year and have a fully functional Proof of Concept. We are seeking funding to pay our developers who are working hard on the software side of this project. We expect to partner with hardware manufacturers once we have a few more iterations of the software completed. We are developing in an invitingly open source manner and once the software is completed anyone can use their own hardware and run DAppNode on it. 

#### Benefits of DAppNode

- Easy set up
- Trustless system 
- Invitingly open source
- Free up space on your devices
- Great for proof of stake mining
- You take control of your nodes 
- Encourages people to have their own server
- Perfect for projects that reward you for hosting, (Filecoin, Mysterium, etc)
- Can facilitate a P2P economy
- Hosting any P2P networking protocols
- Never trust a hosting provider with your private keys again!
- One click node deployment (Full Nodes, DApps)
- Censorship resistance (run your own VPN) 
- A single DAppNode can support an entire community
- DAppNode will build communities and decrease centralization 
- DAppNode is the most important piece of infrastructure for our decencentralized future
- DAppNode allows users to navigate to the pure decentralized web “.eth” domains
- Allows dapp creators to develop a DAppNode package that their customers can run 24x7 in their DAppNodes
- When decentralized protocols with incentivization layer on top, Maintaining a DAppNode should be free or even get some positive reward

### Connection to Aragon

DAppNode uses the Aragon Package Manager, in fact, @Jordi deployed Aragon’s first DAO to Mainnet so that DAppNode could make use of this incredible piece of decentralized infrastructure.

## Grant Request and Legal Structure

DAppNode is a Giveth Social Coding Project and has no formal legal structure, instead it is helping to pioneer the Giveth platform. As a Campaign on the Giveth Platform, every payment is transparently paid out using milestones. We request $90,000 + $30,000 ANT Success Bonus in total be paid to fulfill the Milestones listed in [roadmap.md]()
